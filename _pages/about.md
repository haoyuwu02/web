My research interests are on the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of a wide range problems with **computational mathematics** or **optimization** or **control** background. Previous, I have conducted projects related to convex, non-convex and combinatorial optimziation, signal prosessing. I am working on a project related to game theory, convex optimizaion, dynamic programming now.
