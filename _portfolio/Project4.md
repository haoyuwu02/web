Here is my reasearch project in the fall 2022 in HKUST and I studied some topics related to signal recovery and tensors rank.

The project involved investigating the recovery of signals from observed data imaged by a linear operator, often represented by a random matrix. We explored recovery methods for simultaneous structured signals, such as signals exhibiting both sparsity and low-rank properties, as well as low-rank tensors (low-rank matrices in different tuck directions unfold, also known as tucker rank). 

Our research involved modifying the atomic norm approach for signal recovery and discovered that the linear combination of multiple norms cannot outperform the corresponding best norm, up to a constant factor. We also examined the optimality of using the square norm method for low-rank tensor recovery. Additionally, we explored the prospect of using atomic norms to recover simultaneous signals, treating low-rank tensors as low-rank matrices in different tuck directions unfolding. 

We aimed to identify conditions for improved recovery norms by considering the atomic norm introduced by the intersection of atomic sets corresponding to different signal structures. It works in the case we consider the 2s-sparse structure in R^2n to be the intersection of s-sparse in the first n entries and later n entries separately.

The outcomes and possible future directions of this research were summarized and presented to the IRE fellows in December 2022.
