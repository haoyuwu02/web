Here is my work in summer of 2023 in Ithaca, NY.

Our work focused on applying the refined lemma to improve the estimation of the Hausdorff distance between the Minkowski sum and its convex hull, categorizing the convexity. Our result offers qualitative improvement in specific cases.

The main idea of our work, instead of the traditional method of separately estimating each component of the Minkowski sum, considers all components jointly and uses the constraint on convexity from the refined lemma to reach a tighter bound.

Based on the idea from Prof. Tang, I wrote the whole paper and complete the full argument, basically.
