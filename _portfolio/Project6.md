Here is my first research project in 2021 summer at HKUST, the end of my freshman year. It's a taste of research.

It focused on the problem of how to shrink a curve to a point through a certain way, related heat equation, and curvature of the cure. Itâ€™s a well-known problem and was solved in the 1980s.

At the end, I endetailed a proof in Gage's paper 'The heat equation shrinking convex plane curves', basically via Fatou's lemma.

Here is my report:
