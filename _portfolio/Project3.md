Here is my work in spring 2023, when I was an exchange student in Columbia university.

It's an extensive topic in the Columbia PhD required course IEOR6614 Optimization II delivered by Prof. Eric Balkanski. I employed adaptive algorithms to solve the problem of maximizing submodular functions subjecting to matroid constraints.

Basically speaking, I implemented the threshold method to iteratively add elements to the chosen set or remove elements from the ground set. Besides, I investigated the employment of the binary search for thresholds to solve the partition matroid case with lower adaptivity compared to the original adaptive algorithm utilizing thresholds.

Due to the limited time, I do not have time to summarize the content in the form of a report. But I believe it's a potentially excellent idea to fit the model of submodular into a wide range of optimization problems.
